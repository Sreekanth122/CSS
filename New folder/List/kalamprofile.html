<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
           <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
        </li> 
<br>
            <li>He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.</li>
    <br>    
            <li>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</li>
        <br>    
           <li> In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.</li> 
           <br>
            <li>Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname <b>“Missile Man”</b> </li>
                <br> 
            <li>Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
                </li>
                <br> 
             <li>He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</li>
            <br>
            <li> From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                </li>
                <br>
            <li>His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.
                </li>
                <br> 
            <li>In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Kalam received <b>7</b> honorary doctorates from <b>40</b> universities. The Government of India honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.
